## Description

Answr is a project I started during the final "module" of the software engineering bootcamp I attended, Flatiron School. The idea of the game was to try to imitate the JackBox.tv game "Quiplash." In that way, Answr is a three-player game in which friends take turns answering prompts and voting on the best answer. 

### Technologies

Answr implements a Ruby on Rails API. On the front-end, I used React and Redux. In order to make the game multiplayer, I implemented Rails' ActionCable and connected it on the front-end via the React-Actioncable-Provider package. 

### Playing the game

The game is not yet deployed, so it will be difficult to play on one computer, unless you use two or three different browsers.
