- create new game should open the game by changing the redux store.
- convert modal inputs to forms
- change Navbar into a full Component, not a functional Component
- split up navbars. Actually, gonna do that now.
- make sure a game is no longer available once a third member joins.
- how can i possibly keep the game in play if a user accidentally refreshes?
   - have it controlled by the backend
