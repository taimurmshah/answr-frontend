1. How to keep a user logged in?
  - review Tashawn's auth code
    - annotate it
2. how will i make sure that I can render a page ONLY
   if a user is logged in?
  - Front-end:
    - conditional render of Component based on whether
      JWT is present in local storage.
  - Back-end:
    - do not render information unless a JWT is received
      from front's requests.
      - some authentication method.
3. create all of the Components that a user will use
   to navigate to a game.
4. preload pictures
5. click "join game"
6. select picture first
    - this selection will update redux store for "selected picture"
7. clicking on the picture opens a modal, on which user
   will make the meme
    - behind the scenes, I will mapStateToProps for the "selectedPicture,"
      then interpolate it onto a canvas, put the canvas on an SVG, and then
      display that SVG in the modal.
    - write the logic for writing on the picture; review the chick's code
      - controlled forms for the text
        - rendered in a <text/> tag.
      - event handlers:
        - mouseDown
          - when user starts typing
          - adds a mouseMove that tracks the x/y positions of the words
          - will constantly update local state for the x/y coordinates,
            which will re-render the component with the words at those
            coordinates
        - mouseUp:
          - will remove the event listener, and will update local state
            of the position of those words
          - submit button that will dispatch(thunk) to server with
            user_id, picture_id, and meme (join of the two).
              - meme will have columns for top and bottom text,
                as well as
